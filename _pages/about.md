> "The Internet is a serious business."  â€”  probably a wise man

We often feel that we are free to do whatever we want and make the choices we make. Those who defend this view , point to the fact that we can reflect on our options and decide to act one way or another. 

Determinists, on the other hand, point out that this is a classic case of the difference between appearance and reality. 

We appear to be free when we think and act in a certain way because of past experiences, social conditioning, and even genetic predispositions. These forces not only affect our choices and actions (often without our awareness of them) but create them. 

Freedom is thus an illusion.
